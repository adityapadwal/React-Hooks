# Introduction

This GitHub repository contains examples of React Hooks implemented in a React application using functional components. React Hooks allow us to use state and other React features without writing a class component. With the help of Hooks, we can write more concise and expressive code.

# Features

Demonstrates the usage of various React Hooks in functional components.
Each example is self-contained, allowing easy understanding and experimentation.
Minimalistic React application setup for quick setup and testing.

# Hooks

This project utilizes various React Hooks to manage state, side effects, and more. The following sections provide details on each hook and how it is used within the project.

1. useState 
useState is a built-in React Hook that allows functional components to manage state.
It takes an initial state as an argument and returns a stateful value and a function to update that state.
When the state is updated using the provided function, the component re-renders with the new state value.

2. useReducer:
useReducer is another built-in React Hook that is used for more complex state management.
It is similar to useState, but it uses a reducer function to determine state changes based on the dispatched actions.
The reducer function takes the current state and an action, and returns the new state.

3. useEffect
useEffect is a powerful Hook used to handle side effects in functional components.
It runs after every render (by default) and can be used to perform actions such as fetching data, subscriptions, or manually interacting with the DOM.
It takes a function as its first argument, which will be executed after the component renders.
You can also provide a second argument (an array of dependencies) to control when the effect should be re-run.

4. useRef
useRef is a Hook that returns a mutable ref object whose current property can hold any value.
It is commonly used to access and interact with DOM elements directly, and its value persists across renders without triggering a re-render.

5. useLayoutEffect
useLayoutEffect is similar to useEffect, but it runs synchronously after all DOM mutations.
It is useful when you need to perform DOM measurements or updates that require synchronous access to the DOM right after render.
Keep in mind that using this Hook might cause performance issues if not used carefully, as it can block the rendering process.

6. useImperativeHandle
useImperativeHandle is used in conjunction with forwardRef to expose custom methods of a child component to its parent component when using refs.
It allows you to define what values the ref will have when accessed from the parent component.

7. useContext
useContext allows functional components to consume values from a React context without using the context consumer.
It is used to access data or functionality that is shared across the component tree without the need for prop drilling.

8. useMemo
useMemo is used to memoize the result of a computation and prevent unnecessary re-computation on every render.
It takes a function and an array of dependencies, and it only re-computes the result when the dependencies change.

9. useCallback
useCallback is a React Hook used to memoize functions. It helps optimize performance by returning a memoized version of the function that only changes when its dependencies change. It is particularly useful in scenarios where functions are passed as props to child components to prevent unnecessary re-renders. By memoizing functions with useCallback, you can ensure that the child components don't re-render unless the dependencies of the memoized function have changed.
